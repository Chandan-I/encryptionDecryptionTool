1. File Encryption and Decryption Tool
Overview
This project is a file encryption and decryption tool built in C. It supports multiple encryption algorithms including XOR, Caesar Cipher, and Vigenère Cipher. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using these algorithms, demonstrating an understanding of file handling, security, and cryptographic methods.

Features
XOR Encryption/Decryption: Simple bitwise XOR operation.
Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption: Shifts characters in the file by a fixed number.
Vigenère Cipher Encryption/Decryption: Uses a keyword to shift characters variably.
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:
                git clone https://github.com/Chandan-I/encryptionDecryptionTool
cd your_repository
Compile the Code:

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to compile the C code:
              gcc FileEncryptionTool.c -o FileEncryptionTool
Run the Program:

Execute the compiled program:
              ./FileEncryptionTool
Provide Input and Output Files:

Input File: Create or choose an existing file that you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Output File: Specify the file where the encrypted or decrypted content will be saved.
Choose an Operation:

Follow the on-screen prompts to select the desired encryption/decryption method and provide necessary inputs (e.g., shift values for Caesar Cipher, keyword for Vigenère Cipher).

Example Usage
Encrypt a File Using XOR:

lua
Enter your choice: 1
Enter input file name: input.txt
Enter output file name: encrypted_output.txt
Decrypt a File Using Caesar Cipher:

mathematica
Enter your choice: 4
Enter input file name: encrypted_output.txt
Enter output file name: decrypted_output.txt
Enter shift value: 3
Customization
Modify Algorithms: Update the encryption and decryption functions in the C code to include additional algorithms or adjust existing ones.
